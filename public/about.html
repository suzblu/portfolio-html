<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
"I'm a tech enthusiast with a knack for human connections. 
I'm fueled by curiosity and find myself dancing between extroversion and introversion, adapting to my surroundings.
</p>
In my free time, you'll catch me outdoors, except during winterâ€”I'm not a fan of the cold! To survive those chilly months, I hit the gym religiously starting October 1st, and by December, I'm a winter warrior. 
Come April, I wrap up my gym sessions.
<p>
Oh, and I love to code, even though it didn't come naturally to me!
